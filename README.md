# ObjectAreaCalculator
Made a program by which user can calculate the area of the objects like Triangle, Square, Rectangle and Circle. 
The program is easy to use, all the instructions are given obviously with choices, i am a beginner in the C++ so the 
code is really basic and uses normal statemnts. hope you get some help from my code :)
